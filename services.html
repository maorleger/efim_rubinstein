                        <p><span class="services-strong">What are Veneers?</span></p>
                        <p> Veneers are a thin, semi-translucent laminate permanently bonded to your teeth. While they're not suitable for every patient, veneers are the most aesthetic alternative for a variety of dental conditions involving the front teeth, including: </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Diastemas (spaces between teeth)</li>
                            <li>Broken or chipped teeth</li>
                            <li>Unsightly, stained, or washed-out fillings</li>
                            <li>Permanently stained or discolored teeth that can't be bleached</li>
                            <li>Crooked teeth</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><span class="services-strong">Advantages and Benefits of Veneers</span></p>
                        <p>
                            There are many benefits and advantages to having porcelain veneers placed on your front teeth: 
                            <ul>
                                <li>The procedure takes only two appointments</li>
                                <li>A conservative amount of tooth structure is removed during the procedure</li>
                                <li>Veneers are the most biocompatible material you can use next to the gingiva</li>
                                <li>A healthy &quot;natural&quot; look is achieved; in fact, porcelain veneers are the most aesthetic restoration in dentistry. </li>
                            </ul>
                        </p>
                        <p><span class="services-strong">How are Veneers different from Bonding or Crowns?</span></p>
                        <p> Bonding is a resin filling material that was used for several years to cover the front surface of teeth. Today, we generally use bonding only to fill in small surfaces or cavities and repair chips in teeth. A full crown is when a tooth has had root canal treatment, or when a substantial amount of the entire tooth structure (enamel) has been lost. </p>
                        <p><span class="services-strong">How are  Veneers done?</span></p>
                        <p> At the first appointment the teeth are prepared for the veneers and an impression is taken. This impression is then sent to a lab where each porcelain veneer is custom made to the dentist's specifications and beautiful temporaries are fabricated to simulate your new smile so you can expect to leave the first appointment looking better than when you came in. At the second appointment the veneers are permanently adhered to the natural teeth. </p>
                        <p><span class="services-strong">What to Expect</span></p>
                        <p> Veneers can last indefinitely, depending on how well they are taken care of by the patient. Because veneers are stronger than simple bonding, they are also more resistant to stains and chipping. You must maintain regular oral hygiene at home, and visit us for routine cleanings and exams. This is to ensure that your new veneers will look as good as new. Another important point is that oral habits that damage natural teeth such as nail biting, opening bobby pins, and chewing on hard objects can also damage your new veneers. Once veneers are applied, just treat them like natural teeth. They look great and are extremely durable. </p>

                        <p>Coffee, tea, tobacco, red wine, antibiotics and age can all darken teeth. Patients can choose from two routes to whiter teeth: at-home whitening or in-office whitening.</p>
                        <p><span class="services-strong">At-home bleaching kits</span> use carbamide peroxide solutions to oxidize and bleach your teeth. Your dentist will create customized trays for your mouth based on plaster molds of your teeth. Place the solution in these trays, then hold the tray in your mouth for the amount of time specified by your dentist. He or she will determine a duration of treatment. In a few weeks, return to your dentist for a follow-up appointment.</p>
                        <p><span class="services-strong">In-office bleaching</span> (also called chairside, light-activated or one-hour bleaching) uses hydrogen peroxide gels and a heat or light source, these treatments lighten your teeth by six to eight shades in one to three visits, and sometimes less. The light source can be a plasma arc lamp or a laser. The dentist applies the gel to your teeth, then shines the light source, quickening the work of the gel. When a lamp is used, three twenty-minute gel applications are required. When a laser is used, the dentist treats each tooth individually.</p>

This single-visit procedure provides a fast solution for a more attractive smile and may eliminate the need for orthodontic treatment in some cases.</p>

                        <p>Tooth stains and discolorations that resist professional tooth whitening procedures may also be masked by bonding. Although bonding may not be as long lasting as porcelain veneers or crowns, in can last for a number of years with proper care.</p>

                        <p>Teeth that are too square or too long or too pointed or overlapped or jagged or chipped, can be changed in appearance by recontouring. Recontouring is the most conservative cosmetic treatment. It is a quick and painless procedure whose results can be seen immediately. The procedure is usually done to improve appearance by "creating more harmony or balance" in the look of the smile.</p>

                        <p><span class="services-strong">Cosmetic Gum Recontouring</span></p>
                        <p>Sometimes, excessive gum tissue creates the appearance of "short" teeth. An aesthetic dentist can shift gums to a position that reveals more of the teeth and less of the gums. Crown lengthening is completely different procedure, and has nothing to do with cosmetic gum recontouring! Cosmetic gum recontouring is performed with the aid of laser or special burs.</p>

                        <p>More conservative than a crown, inlays and onlays are two methods of restoring normal tooth structure after decay or other damage. Inlays and onlays are known as indirect fillings because unlike a standard filling that is done in a dentist's office, both are made in a laboratory and cemented or bonded to the surface of the tooth during a second visit to the dentist. And unlike standard fillings, inlays and onlays do not weaken the tooth structure, but actually strengthens it. After the procedure the tooth can bear up to 50 - 75% more chewing force.</p>
                        <p>An inlay is done when the tooth structure replaced is within the cusp tips of the tooth. If the damage is more extensive and the new structure covers the entire chewing surface including one or more tooth cusps, the procedure is called an onlay.</p>

                        <p>Invisalign is the invisible way to straighten teeth using a series of custom-made, nearly undetectable aligners. And it's been proven effective in both clinical research and in practices nationwide. So whether your teeth are crowded, too far apart or have shifted since wearing braces, you'll have a new reason to smile.</p>

                        <p><span class="services-strong">The latest technology makes it possible</span></p>

                        <p>Upon an initial examination, your doctor decides if Invisalign is right for you. Your doctor will write a treatment plan and take an impression of your teeth, which are submitted to Invisalign. Using the latest advances in 3-D computer technology, Invisialign carefully translates your doctor's instructions into a series of precisely customized aligners. You then wear each set of aligners for about two weeks, moving your teeth, gradually - week by week, millimeter by millimeter - until you've achieved the intended result: straighter teeth. Generally, you visit your doctor no more than you would with braces and the length of treatment is about the same.</p>

                        <p><span class="services-strong">No braces. Nothing to hold you back</span></p>

                        <p>Because there are no metal wires and brackets, Invisalign is comfortable. And because it is removeable, eating, brushing and flossing are no problem. You can still enjoy your favorite foods and smile without holding back. With Invisalign, there's nothing to hide.</p>

                        <p><span class="services-strong">Proven results behind great smiles</span></p>

                        <p>In both clinical research and in dental practices nationwide, Invisalign has been proven effective at straightening teeth. And with thousands of doctors already trained to treat their patients with Invisalign you can be assured to find a doctor who's right for you.</p>

                        <p>Crowns (or caps) are dental restorations that are placed over a tooth when conservative restorations are insufficient to restore form and function.</p>

                        <p>A bridge serves to replace a missing tooth or teeth. One type of bridge consists of crowns placed on either side of the missing tooth to connect the replacement tooth or teeth to them. </p>

                        <p>Another type of bridge consists of the replacement tooth attached to the adjacent teeth with wing-like appendages. Bridges can also be supported by dental implants. </p>

                        <p>Crowns and bridges can be made entirely of tooth-colored material, metal, or a combination to provide optimal aesthetics. Some metal-free crowns and bridges incorporate stress-bearing materials to enhance their strength and wear-resistance.</p>

                        <p><span class="services-strong">Is A Crown Right For Me?</span></p>

                        <p>Crowns address aesthetic needs, restore tooth function, and enhance the overall health of your mouth. In cases where teeth have large broken down fillings, a crown can protect and preserve the remaining natural tooth. To enhance your smile a metal-free, tooth colored crown can also replace an older metal/porcelain crown. Following root canal therapy, a crown is typically placed over the remaining tooth structure to preserve aesthetic and tooth function.</p>

                        <p><span class="services-strong">Is a Bridge Right For Me?</span></p>

                        <p>In cases where teeth are missing, a bridge prevents the remaining natural teeth from shifting so that dental health and facial aesthetics are not compromised. Bridges may also provide a permanent, non-removable alternative to removable partial or full dentures. Whether supported by natural teeth or implants, bridges can offer life-like aesthetics and stable chewing surfaces. The can be easily maintained by brushing with modified brushing and flossing.</p>

                        <p><span class="services-strong">What Happens At The First Appointment?</span></p>

                        <p>With both crowns and bridges, the dentist needs to shape the teeth to provide stable support and precise fit of the final restoration.</p>

                        <p>Following tooth preparation, impressions are taken of the teeth, and a replica of your mouth is created for the dental laboratory to make the restoration. You and your dentist with carefully discuss the color, shape, and size of the crown(s) or bridge(s). A temporary restoration is secured to protect the prepared teeth and maintain the precise space left by the tooth until the new restoration is fabricated.</p>

                        <p>If an impant-supported crown or bridges is the best option, the dentist evaluates the patient's health and suitability for the implant placement. The dentist may also proceed with surgical planning or refer the patient to a specialist trained in implant surgery. (For details, see the ProActive Care brochure on Implants.)</p>

                        <p><span class="services-strong">What Happens At the Next Appointment?</span></p>

                        <p>When the crown or bridge is fabricated, the dentist removes the patient's temporary restoration, and tries on the crown or bridges to verify fit and patient approval. Once the restoration is adjusted and approved, the dentist uses a luting cement or an adhesive bonding agent to permanently secure the final restoration.</p>

                        <p>An important step in maintaining a healthy smile is to replace missing teeth. When teeth are missing, the remaining ones can change position, drifting into the surrounding space. Teeth that are out of position can damage tissues in the mouth. In addition, it may be difficult to clean thoroughly between crooked teeth. As a result, you run the risk of tooth decay and periodontal (gum) disease, which can lead to the loss of additional teeth.</p>

                        <p>A removable partial denture fills in the space created by missing teeth and fills out your smile. A denture helps you to properly chew food, a difficult task when you are missing teeth. In addition, a denture may improve speech and prevent a sagging face by providing support for lips and cheeks.</p>

                <div id="implants" class="hidden-div">
                    <p>Dental implants enable dentists to create healthy, attractive smiles in an innovative way. Used to replace one or more missing teeth, implants are another alternative to conventional bridges and dentures. In essence, dental implants act and look like natural teeth. And, because they maintain bone mass, dental implants can help prevent additional tooth loss as well as the sunken facial appearance associated with missing teeth. A dental implant restoration consists of a bio-compatible titanium screw and post topped by a crown bridge or denture.</p>

                    <p>The implant is surgically replaced into the jawbone where it replaces the natural tooth root. In a few months, the implant securely attaches to the bone (called "osseointegration"), allowing it to withstand biting and chewing forces just like a healthy, natural tooth.</p>

                    <p><span class="services-strong">Are Dental Implants Right For Me?</span></p>

                    <p>The most common indications for implant therapy are:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Replacement of one or more missing teeth.</li>
                            <li>Support of a non-removable "bridge" to replace multiple teeth.</li>
                            <li>Support of a removable full or partial denture</li>
                            <li>Patients who successfully pass a screening and evaluation can be considered as candidates for implant replacement.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The primary limiting factor inherent in implant therapy is the amount of bone available to receive and support the implant. If it's determined that a patient does not have enough bone to support an implant restoration, bone grafting procedures may be considered. Heavy smoking and some medical conditions may preclude the use of implant therapy.
